# Real-time Scalable E-commerce Log Processing and Analytics (AWS CI/CD Pipeline)
This project automates real-time log processing and analytics for e-commerce platforms using AWS services like S3, Lambda, OpenSearch, Glue, Athena, and SNS. Logs are stored in S3, processed by Lambda, indexed in OpenSearch for easy searches, and structured by Glue for Athena queries. If something goes wrong, SNS sends instant alerts. AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy handle deployments seamlessly, ensuring smooth updates. This setup makes monitoring errors, tracking performance, and detecting issues effortless, providing real-time insights without the hassle.

## 1. Project Overview

- E-commerce Real-time Log Analytics is a cloud-native solution that empowers e-commerce platforms to ingest, process, and analyze log data in real time, enabling proactive monitoring, troubleshooting, and insights for enhanced operational efficiency. This project is built using a robust AWS CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment process, ensuring seamless integration and delivery of updates.

- The architecture leverages Amazon S3 for scalable log storage, allowing for cost-effective data retention and easy retrieval. AWS Lambda is used for real-time log processing, triggering functions as new data is ingested. Processed logs are then indexed and stored in OpenSearch, enabling powerful search capabilities and visualization of logs through Kibana dashboards.

- To facilitate advanced data analytics, the solution utilizes AWS Glue for data cataloging and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, organizing log data for efficient querying. Amazon Athena is integrated for serverless SQL querying, empowering users to gain actionable insights from the processed logs.

- The entire pipeline is orchestrated using AWS CodePipeline, ensuring automated build, test, and deployment stages. AWS CodeBuild compiles and tests the application, maintaining high code quality, while AWS CodeDeploy handles the deployment to various AWS services. This CI/CD setup accelerates development cycles and reduces time-to-market.

- For alerting and notifications, Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is configured to send real-time alerts based on specific log patterns or errors, ensuring rapid incident response and improved system reliability.
This solution is designed to be highly scalable, resilient, and cost-effective, leveraging AWS's cloud-native services to handle fluctuating e-commerce traffic. It provides real-time visibility into application health, user behavior, and security threats, driving data-driven decision-making.

- E-commerce Real-time Log Analytics is ideal for businesses seeking real-time log monitoring, data analytics, and continuous deployment on the cloud. Its modular architecture allows easy integration with existing systems, making it a versatile solution for modern e-commerce platforms.

## Architecture Overview

![Actual architecture diagram!](https://github.com/akshayshelke1/automated-cicd-pipeline/blob/main/architecture/architecture.png)

1.  #### Developer Workstations: 
Developers write and commit code to a GitHub repository, kicking off the automation process.

2.  #### Continuous Integration:
Jenkins automatically pulls the latest code from GitHub, builds the application, and runs tests to catch any issues early.
It then creates Docker images of the application and pushes them to a Docker Registry, like Amazon ECR, ensuring consistent and reliable deployments.

3.  #### Infrastructure as Code:
Terraform handles the infrastructure setup on AWS, which includes:

  - VPC: For secure networking.
  - IAM Roles and Policies: Ensuring proper security and permissions.
  - EKS Cluster: To run the Kubernetes workloads.
  - RDS: For managing persistent storage needs.

4.  #### Continuous Deployment:
Jenkins takes the Docker images from the registry and deploys them to the Amazon EKS cluster using Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts.
Istio is used as a service mesh to efficiently manage traffic between microservices, enhancing communication and security.

5.  #### Service Mesh with Istio:
Istio plays a key role in managing traffic, securing communication with mutual TLS (mTLS), and providing observability into the microservices environment.
The Istio Ingress Gateway manages all external access to the services, ensuring secure and reliable routing.

6.  #### Monitoring and Logging:
Prometheus collects detailed metrics from the Kubernetes cluster and Istio, providing real-time insights.
Grafana visualizes these metrics through interactive dashboards.
Fluentd centralizes logging, sending logs to Amazon CloudWatch or Elasticsearch for easy monitoring and troubleshooting.
Alertmanager integrates with Prometheus to trigger alerts when issues are detected.

7.  #### Continuous Feedback:
Alertmanager notifies the team through Slack or email, ensuring quick response times to any incidents.
Jenkins provides continuous feedback on build and deployment statuses, keeping developers in the loop throughout the CI/CD pipeline.
This setup ensures a seamless flow from code commit to deployment, with robust monitoring, security, and feedback mechanisms, making the application scalable, secure, and highly observable.
